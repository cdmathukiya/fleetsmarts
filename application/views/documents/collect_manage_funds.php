	<p>This Authorization to Collect and Manage Funds(the "Agreement") is entered into this <?=date('jS',strtotime($date))?> day of <?=date('F',strtotime($date))?>, <?=date('Y',strtotime($date))?>, (the "Effective Date") by and between, a______________ limited liability company ("Member"), and United Motor Carrier Cooperative, LCA, an Utah limited cooperative association ("Cooperative").</p>
	<p>NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and benefits set forth herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is acknowledged by the parties hereby agree as follows:</p>
	<p>1. Authorization and Management. Pursuant to Article VI, Section 2 of the Bylaws, the Member does hereby authorize (the "Authorization") the Cooperative to collect and manage all of the Member's receivables, income, revenue, payments, and other any form of compensation earned by or paid to the Member to the Cooperative ("Funds"). Such Authorization includes the right to demand, sue, collect, and enforce any payment obligations of a third party of the Member. In order to provide the management services below, if for any reason a check or payment which should have been delivered, provided, or collected by the Cooperative is received by the Member, the Member will (1) immediately notify the Cooperative of its receipt of funds, and (2) remit payment of such amounts within two (2) business days.</p>
	<p>2. Management of Funds by Cooperative. The Cooperative uses billing, accounting and fund management software, programs and processes, called Fleetsmarts, to manage the Funds received by the Cooperative from the Member and all other members. Fleetsmarts has been licensed by the Cooperative to assist the members of the Cooperative to manage funds, pay bills, and account for and track funds. The Cooperative may initially pool all members' Funds and use the Funds received to make the following payments on behalf of the Member and other members ("Expenses") as set forth herein:</p>
	<p>a. Payment of the Cooperative's expenses based on a per mile driven fee agreed to by all Members and the Cooperative;</p>
	<p>b. Payment of owner/operator payments and advances;</p>
	<p>c. Payment of for fuel;</p>
	<p>d. Payment of insurance;</p>
	<p>e. Payment of equipment vendors;</p>

	<p>g. Dispatch Services;</p>
	<p>h. Payment of repair shops; and</p>
	<p>i. Any other expenses and payments mutually agreed upon by the Member and the Cooperative.</p>
	<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Cooperative is not liable or responsible for the Member's various Expenses set forth above, but is merely providing a service of managing and paying such Expenses on behalf of the Member. As a convenience and service to the Member and all members, the Cooperative, from time to time, may pay for miscellaneous expenses incurred by the Member. Any expenses paid for by the Cooperative on behalf of a Member shall be considered the sole expense of the Member and is considered a cash advance to be reimbursed to the Cooperative during the weekly settlement process.</p>
	<p>The Cooperative, through Fleetsmarts, will provide a profit and loss statement for the Member's truck and any other truck leased on to the Member. The Cooperative shall remit, via settlement, to the Member its net profits each  week, contingent upon the member actively participating in the motor carrier of which he has ownership interest in (Participation is indicated by the Member's operation of, one or more of the motor carrier's leased, owned, or rented motor vehicles). If the Member is not actively participating in the motor carrier, all settlements will be held until the Member is actively participating in the motor carrier again. At that point, the settlements of all outstanding profits and losses will resume on the regular settlement schedule. If the Member is not actively participating in the motor carrier and is no longer in good membership standing with the Cooperative, the Cooperative has up to 90 days to prepare a final statement, which will be presented to the Member for review and settlement.</p>
	<p>3. Accounting. The Cooperative shall keep accurate and detailed records of the Funds and expenses paid on behalf of the Member to ensure that all amounts are properly paid. The Member hereby acknowledges that its respective Funds may be pooled with other members Funds and used to pay other members expenses to provide cash flow assistance to each member, which amounts, if any, shall be returned and credited towards the Member and repaid by the Cooperative and the other members in a timely manner.</p>
	<p>4. Termination. The Authorization shall be effective until ninety (90) days after the Member is disassociated from the Cooperative as set forth Article V, Section 3 of the Bylaws. Any Funds earned or generated by the Member during the first sixty (60) days of the ninety day period, shall be paid and turned over to the Cooperative for up to ninety (90) days after disassociation. Any income generated or earned, but not paid during last thirty (30) days of the ninety (90) day period shall not be considered assigned to or the property of the Cooperative. The Cooperative shall continue to pay the Expenses, except that no funds may be used for payment of other member's expenses during the ninety (90) day period, for up to ninety (90) days after disassociation as possible from receipt of the Member's Funds. Within ninety (90) days after disassociation, the Cooperative shall provide final profit and loss statement and remit any remaining Funds of the Member to the Member for final settlement.</p>
	<p>The Member hereby acknowledges that the Cooperative's payment of the Member's Expenses during the ninety (90) day period is contingent upon the Cooperative receiving the Member's Funds, and the Cooperative is not liable for any creditors of the Member not being paid because of lack of Funds collected by the Cooperative on behalf of the Member. </p>
