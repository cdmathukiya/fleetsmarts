	<h1>ADDENDUM B</h1>
	<p>1. CARRIER agrees to pay CONTRACTOR, for use of CONTRACTOR'S Equipment described in Addendum A in accordance with the attached Guaranteed Revenue Rate from Carrier to Contractor for loads transported by CONTRACTOR, as provided for in 1 of that Motor Carrier - Independent Contractor/Owner-Operator Agreement between CARRIER and CONTRACTOR dated the <?=date('jS',strtotime($date))?> day of <?=date('F',strtotime($date))?>, <?=date('Y',strtotime($date))?> (hereinafter "the Agreement"). Said amount, plus all amounts received by CARRIER for any fuel surcharges, loading or unloading charges, or tolls is inclusive of any and all compensation and represents the total compensation to be paid to CONTRACTOR under the Agreement.</p>
	<p>2. CARRIER agrees to pay CONTRACTOR 100% of all tolls, fuel surcharges, detention charges, stop pay, loading and unloading charges and other accessorial charges applicable to each load.</p>
	<p>3. The Guaranteed Revenue Rate is a calculated rate used to determine the Revenues associated with a load and all miles. </p>
	<p>The Guaranteed Rate is dependent upon the national average price of diesel fuel as reported at http://fuelgaugereport.aaa.com/ on the date of booking the load. The Guaranteed Revenue Rate is comprised of two amounts: 1. The "Fuel Surcharge," which is calculated by dividing the Nat'l Diesel Fuel Avg by the expected miles per gallon of the truck
	and 2. the "Base Rate," which is $0.66 per mile for everything other than refrigerated freight, and $0.74 per mile for refrigerated freight.</p>
	<p>Due to the dependency of market load rates on national fuel prices, for every positive or negative $0.06 (when loaded) or $0.075 (when deadheading) or $0.09 (when deadheading) change in the national average price of diesel fuel, the Guaranteed Rate will fluctuate $0.01 respectively. The exact formula to determine the guaranteed rate is as follows:</p>
	<p>(Nat'l Diesel Fuel Avg) / (6.0 mpg) + $0.81 = Guaranteed Rate (Loaded)</p>
	<p>(Nat'l Diesel Fuel Avg) / (6.0 mpg) + $0.83 = Guaranteed Rate (Loaded with refrigerated freight)</p>
	<p>(Nat'l Diesel Fuel Avg) / (7.5 mpg) + $0.81 = Guaranteed Rate (Deadhead)</p>
	<p>(Nat'l Diesel Fuel Avg) / (9.0 mpg) + $0.81 = Guaranteed Rate (Bobtail)</p>
	<p>For example: If the Nat'l Diesel Fuel Avg price was $3.00 the Guaranteed Rate would be $1.31 when loaded and $1.21 when deadheading and $1.14 when bobtailing. The Guaranteed Rate will be rounded to the nearest cent.</p>
	<p>*Both the base rate and the fuel surcharge rate are subject to change according to equipment standards IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement, this <?=date('jS',strtotime($date))?> day of <?=date('F',strtotime($date))?>, <?=date('Y',strtotime($date))?>, which shall be binding upon both parties and remain in full force and effect unless and until canceled or terminated by either party according to the terms of this Agreement.</p>
